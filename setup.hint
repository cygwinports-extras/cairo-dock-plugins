ldesc: "Cairo-Dock is a unified interface to your desktop: it provides a 
dock, a taskbar, and many applets that can be placed either inside the 
dock or on your desktop, at your convenience. It uses Cairo or OpenGL to 
render nice graphics with hardware acceleration, which makes it very 
smooth and low on CPU. It's highly customisable and comes with a lot of 
ready-to-use themes."
